- Scheduler processes pending briefs every 30 minutes
- Perfect for batch processing

### Option 2: Real-time Webhook
- Set up Notion webhook to trigger on new rows
- Instant processing when new briefs are added
- Best for immediate results

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use webhook for urgent briefs
- Use scheduler for batch processing
- Maximum flexibility

## Notion Webhook Setup

1. Go to your Notion integration settings
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/notion`
3. Subscribe to "Page created" and "Page updated" events
4. Test with a new database entry

## Scaling Tips

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple briefs in sequence to avoid rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Failed briefs are logged and can be retried
- **Monitoring**: Use the health check endpoint for uptime monitoring
- **Caching**: Consider caching AI responses for similar topics

## Troubleshooting

- Check API keys and Notion permissions
- Verify database property names match configuration
- Monitor console logs for detailed error messages
- Test with simple topics first
